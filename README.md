Hydra: Static Analyzer for Sui Move

Hydra is a proof of concept static analysis tool designed specifically for Sui Move smart contracts. It performs deep analysis of Move code to detect potential security vulnerabilities, reference safety issues, and violations of Sui-specific safety patterns.

Roadmap
Phase 1: Reference Safety Analysis (Q1 2024)
 Focus: Establish a foundation for analyzing reference safety within the Move programming model.
Key Deliverables:
 Tracks reference lifetimes and potential escapes:
Monitor and validate reference usage to prevent premature deallocation or unsafe escapes.
 Verifies Moveâ€™s strict borrowing rules:
Ensure adherence to Move's borrowing model, avoiding violations such as double mutable borrowing.
 Analyzes reference flows across module boundaries:
Ensure safe and compliant reference interactions between modules.
 Move Prover integration:
Simplify formal verification by generating and checking verification conditions (VCs) for reference flow.
 Identifies unsafe aliasing patterns:
Detect potential issues like race conditions or unintended side effects caused by improper aliasing.
Phase 2: Object Safety Verification (Q2 2024)
 Focus: Extend analysis capabilities to cover object safety across modules.
Key Deliverables:
 Validates object transfer patterns:
Ensure safe and predictable object transfers between modules.
 Ensures proper shared object access:
Protect shared objects from illegal mutations and maintain ownership integrity.
 Verifies ownership model compliance:
Confirm adherence to Move's ownership rules to prevent conflicts.
 Detects "hot potato" anti-patterns:
Identify inefficient or risky object passing patterns.
 Beta Release: Closed beta rollout with early adopters testing these features.
Phase 3: Capability Analysis (Q3 2024)
 Focus: Strengthen capability safety to ensure secure permission and delegation models.
Key Deliverables:
 Tracks capability flow and delegation:
Monitor and validate safe delegation of capabilities across modules.
 Identifies privilege escalation risks:
Detect scenarios of improper privilege escalation.
 Verifies permission models:
Ensure correct implementation of permission models to prevent unauthorized access.
 Analyzes cross-module capability usage:
Verify safe and compliant usage of capabilities across module boundaries.
 Move Prover integration:
Enable easier formal verification of capability flow and delegation models.
 Version 1 Release: Full public release incorporating object and capability safety features.
Phase 4: Global Storage Safety (Q4 2024)
 Focus: Ensure comprehensive global safety, integrating advanced formal verification tools.
Key Deliverables:
 Resource persistence guarantees:
Validate consistent resource lifetimes within the global state.
 Key-value store integrity:
Ensure integrity and safety of state storage systems.
 Global state invariants:
Enforce state consistency checks across modules.
 Cross-function state consistency:
Verify that state changes across functions are valid and predictable.
 Formal verification for economic and consensus safety:
Introduce methods to validate cross-chain interactions and economic models.
 Version 2 Release: Advanced safety features with fully integrated global storage analysis.
Move Prover Integration for Formal Verification
At each phase, Hydra integrates with Move Prover to provide:
 Simplified formal verification: Automatically generate verification conditions (VCs) to validate safety properties.
 Developer-friendly workflows: Offer a unified tool for developers and security researchers to compile, verify, and validate safety across contracts, making formal verification accessible and efficient.
